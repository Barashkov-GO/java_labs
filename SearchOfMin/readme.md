# Search Of Min

Search Of Min is a Java-based application that demonstrates different approaches for finding the minimum element in an array. The project provides implementations for finding the minimum element sequentially, using multi-threading, and employing the Fork-Join framework. It also includes a comparative analysis of time and memory costs for each implementation.

## Features

- Demonstrates three different approaches to find the minimum element in an array.
- Compares the time and memory costs of each implementation.
- Utilizes sequential processing, multi-threading, and the Fork-Join framework.
- Provides insights into the efficiency of different algorithms for this common task.
